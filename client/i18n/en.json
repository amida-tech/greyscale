        "SECTION_CONTENT1": "<p>Nasal surgery is a grouping term for procedures performed to correct a variety of nasal deformities.&nbsp; A nasal deformity may be external and/or internal.&nbsp; Nasal deformities may be grouped into four categories:</p><ul><li>Congenital: Deformities resulting from developmental anomalies;</li><li>Acquired: Deformities due to trauma, infections, cancer, disease, or previous surgery;</li><li>Aesthetic (Cosmetic): Conditions, exclusive of congenital and/or acquired deformities, for which the patient desires a change in nasal appearance to enhance self-image;&nbsp; and,</li><li>Functional: Conditions with impaired nasal breathing unrelated to appearance.</li></ul><p><strong>Rhinoplasty</strong></p><p>Rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure to alter the appearance of the nose, the width of the nostrils, and/or change the angle between the nose and the upper lip.&nbsp; It is performed alone or in combination with other procedures, such as septoplasty and turbinoplasty, to correct deformities that result from nasal trauma, either acquired or iatrogenic, airway obstruction related to septal and bony deviations, turbinate hypertrophy or congenital defects.</p><p><strong>Nasal Valve Suspension</strong></p><p>Nasal valve collapse is a common cause of nasal airway obstruction.&nbsp; Nasal valve suspension is a surgical approach for nasal valve repair that involves suspension of the valve to the orbital rim or the use of lateral suture(s) suspension.&nbsp; Nasal valve suspension refers to a surgical approach for nasal valve repair that involves attaching a suture to the orbital rim, which is passed through the collapsed valve, then returned to the anchor site at the orbital rim and tied, thus resulting in a repaired nasal valve that presumably allows for less obstructed airflow.</p><p><strong>Reconstructive Nasal and Sinus Surgery for Congenital or Acquired Functional Nasal Deformities&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Nasal deformities may be congenital, (e.g., cleft palate) or acquired (e.g., trauma, disease). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Congenital birth defects have a variety of presentations, including cleft nasal deformity, which may be associated with cleft lip and/or cleft palate, where the nasal structures are distorted and abnormally developed.&nbsp; Some congenital abnormalities may not be fully evident until some years later.&nbsp; Surgical correction of congenital birth defects may involve staged procedures, flaps, or grafts.&nbsp; Since the clefts of palate and lip vary considerably in size, shape, and degree of deformity, the planning of the stages of surgery should be individualized.&nbsp; Nasal correction associated with cleft lip/palate may be delayed until adolescence or performed at the time of initial repair.&nbsp; Children with cleft lip and/or palate usually have a deviated nasal septum due to the asymmetric bony base associated with the defect.&nbsp; Initially, the deviation may not cause airway problems due to the facial cleft providing a patent, low-resistance airway passage.&nbsp; As a result of the repair of the facial cleft, the nasal resistance increases and the deviated septum may then cause nasal airway obstruction.</p><p>Acquired nasal deformities may include disease (i.e., tumors), trauma (i.e., motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries).&nbsp; These can be repaired with various techniques depending upon presentation. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Endoscopic Sinus Surgery / Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery, (FESS)</strong></p><p>Endoscopic sinus surgery is accomplished using fiberoptic technology for various diagnoses as it has precision, but is less invasive than previous surgical techniques, and causes less discomfort to the patient.&nbsp; Endoscopic surgery remains the treatment of choice for many diagnoses including medically refractory chronic rhinosinusitis with or without polyps. &nbsp;</p><p>FESS is a type of surgical technique to treat medically unresponsive chronic sinusitis and other serious conditions of the nasal sinuses that result in impaired sinus drainage.&nbsp; FESS utilizes a thin optical telescope to access the nasal sinuses, eliminating the need for an external incision to remove diseased tissue and bone, resulting in improved drainage and function.&nbsp; Recently, balloon dilation catheters have been introduced as an alternative to or adjunctive tool during conventional FESS.&nbsp; Prior to FESS, standard treatment involved surgical opening in the upper jaw above the teeth.&nbsp; The use of FESS allows for shorter surgery and healing times, less postoperative discomfort and fewer complications.&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Balloon </strong></span><strong>Ostial Dilation</strong></p><p>Chronic sinusitis is characterized by purulent nasal discharge, usually without fever, that persists for weeks to months.&nbsp; Symptoms of congestion often accompany the nasal discharge.&nbsp; There also may be mild pain and/or headache.&nbsp; <span>Thickening of mucosa may restrict or close natural openings between sinus cavities and the nasal fossae, although symptoms are variable because considerable variation exists in the location and shape of these sinus ostia.&nbsp;</span></p><p>A new<span>er</span> procedure, <span>balloon ostial dilation (also known as </span>balloon sinuplasty&trade;) is proposed as an alternative to endoscopic sinus surgery for those with chronic sinusitis. <span>The goal of this technique, when used as an alternative to FESS, is to achieve improved sinus drainage using a less invasive approach. When used as an adjunct to FESS, it is intended to facilitate and/or increase access to the sinuses. </span>The procedure involves placing a guidewire in the sinus ostium, advancing a balloon over the guidewire, and then stretching the opening by inflating the balloon.&nbsp; The guidewire location is confirmed with fluoroscopy or with direct transillumination of the targeted sinus cavity.&nbsp; General anesthesia may be needed for this procedure to minimize patient movement.&nbsp; This technique is said to allow improved sinus drainage.</p><p><strong>Implantable Sinus Stents</strong></p><p>There are a number of postoperative treatment regimens, and the optimal regimen is not certain. Options include saline irrigation, nasal packs, topical steroids, systemic steroids, topical decongestants, oral antibiotics, and/or sinus cavity d&eacute;bridement.&nbsp;</p><p>Some form of sinus packing is generally performed postoperatively. Simple dressings moistened with saline can be inserted manually following surgery. Foam dressings are polysaccharide substances that form a gel when hydrated and can be used as nasal packs for a variety of indications.(1) Middle meatal spacers are splint-like devices that prop open the sinus cavities post-ESS, but are not capable of drug delivery. There is some RCT evidence that middle meatal spacers may reduce the formation of synechiae following ESS, although the available studies have significant heterogeneity in this outcome. (6)</p><p>Implantable sinus stents are another option for postoperative management following ESS. These implants are inserted under endoscopic guidance. They are intended to stabilize the sinus openings and the turbinates, reduce edema, and/or prevent obstruction by adhesions. They also have the capability of being infused with medication that can be delivered topically over an extended period of time, and this local delivery of medications may be superior to topical application in the postoperative setting.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Status</strong></p><p>The PROPEL&trade; system was granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval under the premarketing approval program in August 2011. This device is a self-expanding, bioabsorbable, steroid-eluting stent that is intended for use in the ethmoid sinus. It is placed via endoscopic guidance using a plunger that is included with the device. Steroids (mometasone furoate) are embedded in a polyethylene glycol polymer, which allows sustained release of the drug over an approximate duration of 30 days. The device is dissolvable over a period of several weeks, and therefore does not require removal.</p><p>The Relieva Stratus&trade; MicroFlow spacer is a balloon-based device that acts as a spacer and medication delivery system. It was FDA-approved under the 510(k) program in October 2011. It is indicated for use as a postoperative spacer to maintain an opening to the sinuses within the first 14 days postoperatively. It is placed via a catheter under endoscopic guidance. This device is temporary and requires manual removal after 30 days, with implantation of a new device if needed. It is approved for infusion with saline, but not for use with other medications such as steroids. This device is no longer marketed in the U.S.</p>",

When performed in combination with FESS, it is sometimes referred to as a hybrid procedure, because there are elements of both balloon sinus ostial dilation and FESS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials (RTC)</strong></p><p>The REMODEL study was an industry-sponsored study RCT that compared balloon ostial dilation as a stand-alone procedure with FESS. (14) A total of 105 patients with recurrent acute sinusitis or chronic sinusitis and failure of medical therapy were randomized to balloon ostial dilation or FESS. Balloon ostial dilation was performed with the Entellus device, which is labeled for a transantral approach. FESS consisted of maxillary antrostomy and uncinectomy with or without anterior ethmoidectomy. Thirteen patients withdrew consent before treatment, 11 in the FESS group (21%) and 2 in the balloon ostial dilation group (4%). The primary outcomes were the change in the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) score at 6-month follow-up, and the mean number of d&eacute;bridements performed postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included recovery time, complication rates, and rates of revision surgery. Both superiority and noninferiority analyses were performed on these outcomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A total of 91 patients were available at 6-month follow-up. The improvement in the SNOT-20 score was 1.67&plusmn;1.10 in the balloon dilation group and 1.60&plusmn;0.96 in the FESS arm (p=0.001 for noninferiority). Postoperative d&eacute;bridements were more common in the FESS group compared with balloon dilation (1.2&plusmn;1.0 vs 0.1&plusmn;0.6 in the FESS arm, p&lt;0.001 for superiority). Patients in the balloon dilation arm returned to normal daily activities earlier (1.6 days vs 4.8 days, p=0.002 for superiority), and required fewer days of prescription pain medications (0.9 days vs 2.8 days, p=0.002 for superiority). There were no major complications in either group, and 1 patient in each group required revision surgery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bikhazi et al reported 1-year follow-up from the REMODEL study in 2014.(15) A total of 89 subjects (96.7%) were available for follow up to 1 year. The improvement in the SNOT-20 score was 1.64 in the balloon dilation arm and 1.65 in the FESS arm (p&lt;0.001 for noninferiority). During 1-year postprocedure, both the balloon dilation and FESS groups had fewer self-reported rhinosinusitis episodes (reduction in 4.2 episodes in the balloon arm and reduction in 3.5 episodes in the FESS; not significantly different between groups).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marzetti et al reported results from a small RCT that compared balloon ostial dilation with an unspecified device (or devices) with FESS in the treatment of sinus headache. (16) The study included 83 patients with sinus headache, based on American Academy of Otolaryngology‒Head and Neck Surgery, 44 randomized to conventional endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and 35 to balloon ostial dilation. In the balloon dilation group, 23 patients were &ldquo;only frontal sinus balloon&rdquo; patients, in which balloon catheters were the only tools used for frontal sinus sinusotomy, and 12 were &ldquo;hybrid,&rdquo; in which balloon catheters and traditional ESS were used concurrently. It is not specified how patients were selected for these groups. At 6-month follow-up, scores on the SNOT-22 improved from 28.6 at baseline to 7.8 in the ESS group and from 27.3 at baseline to 5.3 in the balloon ostial dilation group, with a statistically significant reduction in both groups (p&lt;0.001). At 6-month follow-up, headache scores based on visual analog score improved from 6.5 at baseline to 5.4 in the ESS group and from 7.1 at baseline to 1.2 in the balloon ostial dilation group (p&lt;0.001).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another small RCT was published by Achar et al in 2012. (17) This trial enrolled 24 patients with chronic sinusitis who had failed medical therapy and were scheduled for surgery. Patients were randomized to balloon dilation or FESS and followed for a total of 24 weeks. The primary outcome measures were changes in the SNOT-20 score and the saccharine clearance time (SCT) test. Both groups improved significantly on both outcome measures. The degree of improvement was greater for the functional endoscopic dilatation sinus surgery group compared with the FESS group on both the SNOT-20 score (43.8&plusmn;15.2 vs 29.7&plusmn;12.3, p&lt;0.03) and on the SCT score (7.5&plusmn;5.1 vs 3.5&plusmn;4.3, p=0.03).

Patients generally had a history of recurrent rhinosinusitis despite medical management, but there were no consistent eligibility criteria. Individuals who received a combination of the 2 procedures, or who were missing preoperative SNOT-20 scores, were excluded from the analysis. The SNOT-20 score 3 months after the operation was significantly higher (more symptoms) in the endoscopic surgery group (see Table 1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Table 1.</strong></span><strong> SNOT-20 Scores in Friedman et al.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><table cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tbody><tr><td valign='top'><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td valign='top'><p><strong>Balloon Sinus Ostial Dilation</strong></p></td><td valign='top'><p><strong>Endoscopic Surgery</strong></p></td><td valign='top'><p><strong>p</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><p>Baseline, mean (SD)</p></td><td valign='top'><p>2.80 (0.52)</p></td><td valign='top'><p>2.70 (0.85)</p></td><td valign='top'><p>NS</p></td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><p>Three months postoperatively, mean (SD)</p></td><td valign='top'><p>&nbsp;</p><p>0.78 (0.55)</p></td><td valign='top'><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.29 (0.87)</p></td><td valign='top'><p>&nbsp;</p><p>0.006</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Postoperative pain, as measured by the number of days patients used a narcotic, was significantly lower in the group of patients who underwent balloon sinus <span>ostial dilation </span>(0.8&plusmn;0.7 days) compared with ESS (1.3&plusmn;1.0; p=0.011). The patient satisfaction measure also favored the balloon <span>sinus ostial dilation group</span>. The primary complications reported were turbinate lateralization, or scarring, which occurred in 8 patients who underwent balloon <span>sinus ostial dilation</span> and in 3 patients who had endoscopic surgery. One or more sinus infections occurred in 6 balloon sinus ostial dilation patients and 9 endoscopic surgery patients during the 3-month follow-up; 1 patient in the balloon <span>sinus ostial dilation</span> group required revision surgery due to persistent infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Section Summary</strong></p><p>There are a number of small randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies of balloon ostial dilation as a stand-alone procedure, compared with FESS. These studies generally report that short-term outcomes of balloon ostial dilation are similar to those of FESS. However, there remains a lack of high-quality evidence on the comparative efficacy of the 2 procedures. Only 1 RCT, the REMODEL study (n=105 patients randomized), was likely to have adequate power to detect group differences. This study reported noninferiority for the change in the SNOT-20 scores and superiority for balloon ostial dilation on postoperative recovery and pain medication use.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Single-Arm Studies</strong></p><p>A prospective multicenter series of 71 subjects with CRS was published by Cutler et al. (19) Successful dilatation was achieved in 129 of 132 (98%) of maxillary sinuses. Half of the procedures were performed in the operating room and half performed in the clinic setting. Tolerance of the procedure was good, with patients discharged within 2 hours after the procedure was completed. There were statistically significant improvements in symptoms at 3, 6, and 12 months postprocedure, with no difference in efficacy by site of procedure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Practice Guidelines and Position Statements</strong></p><p><span>A 2008 practice guideline on balloon catheter dilation of paranasal sinus ostia from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence (UK) states: </span>&ldquo;Current evidence on the short-term efficacy of balloon catheter dilation of paranasal sinus ostia for chronic sinusitis is adequate and raises no major safety concerns. Therefore, this procedure can be used provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit.&rdquo; <span>(20)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012 the American Academy of Otolaryngology&ndash; Head and Neck Surgery offered a statement on balloon ostial dilation reaffirmed their 2010 position statement which states: &ldquo;sinus ostial dilation is an appropriate therapeutic option for selected patient with sinusitis. This approach may be used alone or in conjunction with other instruments&hellip;.&rdquo; (21)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The American Rhinologic Society has offered a statement that endoscopic balloon catheter sinus dilation technology is acceptable and safe in the management of sinus disease. (22)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Implantable Sinus Stents</strong></p><p>There are a number of postoperative treatment regimens, and the optimal regimen is not certain. Options include saline irrigation, nasal packs, topical steroids, systemic steroids, topical decongestants, oral antibiotics, and/or sinus cavity d&eacute;bridement. There have been a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have evaluated various treatment options, but all different strategies have not been rigorously evaluated. (2-5) A systematic review evaluated the evidence for these therapies. (1) The authors of this review concluded that the evidence was not strong for any of these treatments but that some clinical trial evidence supported improvements in outcomes. The strongest evidence was for use of nasal saline irrigation, topical nasal steroid spray, and sinus cavity d&eacute;bridement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are important in this area in order to adequately compare implantable stents to alternative treatment regimens and to minimize the effects of confounders on outcomes. Case series and trials without control groups offer little in the way of relevant evidence, as improvement in symptoms is expected after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and because there are multiple clinical and treatment variables which may confound outcomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Randomized controlled trials</strong></p><p>There are two small RCTs of the Propel&trade; sinus implant.(7,8) The two Propel&trade; trials are of similar design and both are sponsored by the manufacturer (Intersect ENT&trade;, Palo Alto, CA.). Both compare an implant that is steroid-eluting versus an identical implant that is not steroid-eluting. Thus these trials test the value of drug delivery via a stent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Murr et al</span>. (8) The first RCT of this implant was published in 2011. A total of 38 patients with refractory chronic rhinosinusitis were included in the efficacy evaluation, and an additional 5 patients were enrolled for a safety evaluation. An intra-patient control design was used, meaning that each patient received a drug-eluting stent on one side and a non-drug-eluting stent on the other via random assignment. Patients were not permitted to use topical or oral steroids for 30 days following the procedure. A 14-day course of antibiotics was given to all patients. The primary end point was the degree of inflammation recorded on follow-up endoscopy at day 21 postprocedure, as scored by a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). There were also semiquantitative grading performed for polypoid changes, middle turbinate position, and</p><p>adhesions/synechiae. The clinicians recording the outcomes were the same physicians who were treating the patients. One patient withdrew prior to study completion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The difference in inflammation scores at 21 days was significant in favor of the steroid-eluting group. The estimated difference in scores from graphical representation was approximately 18 units on the 0 to 100 VAS scale. The percent of patients having polypoid changes was 18.4% in the steroid-eluting group versus 36.8% in the non-steroid-eluting group (p=0.039). Adhesions were also significantly less common in the steroid-eluting group (5.3% vs 21.1%, p=0.03). There were no significant differences in the appearance or position of the middle turbinate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Advance II trial</span><span>. (7) The Advance II trial was an RCT </span>of the Propel&trade; sinus <span>implant for 105 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis </span>refractory to medical management. This study also used an intra-patient control design with each patient receiving a drug-eluting stent on one side and a non-drug-eluting stent on the other via random assignment. Patients were not permitted to use topical or oral steroids for 30 days following the procedure. A 14-day course of antibiotics was given to all patients. The primary efficacy outcome was reduction in the need for postoperative interventions at day 30 following the procedure. A panel of 3 independent experts, who were blinded to treatment assignment and clinical information, viewed the endoscopy results and determined whether an intervention was indicated. The primary safety end point was the absence of clinically significant increased ocular pressure through day 90.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were 3 patients lost to follow-up (2.9%), and 9 patients (8.6%) could not be evaluated because the video of the endoscopy could not be graded. Two patients had the device removed within 30 days of placement. Of the remaining patients, the need for postoperative intervention by expert judgment was found in 33.3% of patients in the steroid-eluting arm versus 46.9% in the non-steroid-eluting arm (p=0.028). According to the judgments of the clinical investigators who were treating the patients, intervention was required in 21.9% of the steroid-eluting group and 31.4% of the non-steroid-eluting group (p=0.068). The reduction in interventions was primarily driven by a 52% reduction in lysis of adhesions (p=0.005). The primary safety hypothesis was met, as there were no cases of clinically significant increases in ocular pressure recorded over the 90-day period following the procedure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nonrandomized studies</strong></p><p>The ADVANCE study (9) was a prospective, multicenter single-arm trial of 50 patients who were scheduled to undergo ESS. The end points evaluated on follow-up endoscopies were the degree of inflammation scored on a 100-mm VAS and semiquantitative grading for polypoid changes, middle turbinate position, and adhesions. By day 7 postprocedure, the inflammation scores were in the &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; range and remained there for the rest of the time points. At 1 month, polypoid lesions were present in 10% of patients, adhesions in 1.1%, and middle turbinate lateralization in 4.4%. Scores on the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 and the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index improved significantly in the first month postprocedure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A case series was published of 23 patients with refractory rhinosinusitis who underwent ESS and were treated postoperatively with the Relieva Stratus Microflow Spacer Device infused with triamcinolone. (10) Over a period of 6 months, there were significant improvements on multiple sinus-related outcome measures such as the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 and the Lund-McKay CT (computed tomography) scan scores. There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative complications reported.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Systematic reviews</strong></p><p>A systematic review of early postoperative care following ESS was published in 2011. (11) This review evaluated a number of different postoperative regimens, including stents. The review included one RCT by Cote et al and 2 nonrandomized studies. Some of the devices included in these studies are considered middle meatal spacers and not included in the review of evidence for this policy. The overall level of evidence was judged as B (RCT with limitations). The authors concluded that topical steroids delivered by the &ldquo;nonstandard&rdquo; route required further study and that the results of current studies could not be extrapolated to larger populations. Based on this evidence, they did not recommend use of stents, but considered them an &ldquo;option&rdquo; for postoperative care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Han et al. performed a meta-analysis of the 2 published RCTs of the Propel&trade; implant, (12) both of which compared a steroid-eluting stent with a non-steroid-eluting stent. The results of the 2 RCTs were combined at the patient level, with reanalysis of the endoscopy videos by a panel of 3 independent ear, nose, and throat experts. The combined results were that the steroid-eluting device reduced postoperative interventions by 35% (p&lt;0.001), reduced lysis of adhesions by 51% (p&lt;0.001), and reduced the need for oral steroids by 46% (p&lt;0.001).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Implantable sinus stents have been used post-ESS (endoscopic sinus surgery) with the intent of maintaining patency of the sinuses and delivering local steroids. Two RCTs have compared the Propel&trade; device with steroids to the same device without steroids and reported that the steroid-eluting device reduced postoperative inflammation, reduced the need for oral steroids, and reduced the need for postoperative reinterventions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
