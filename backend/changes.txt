1) All column comments are removed as sequelize does not support comments. Column comments does not contribute to any functionality.
2) Sequence Entities_id_seq replaced by Essences_id_seq. This is used by Essences so this appeared to be error anyway.
3) For a number of Sequences 'MINVALUE 0' settings are changed with 'NO MINVALUE'. All 'START WITH' fields now start with 1.
4) All timestamps are now timestamp with time zone without precision. This was not consistent within the tables with no apperant reason.
5) Following sequence names are replaced by what is the standard based on the table it is used:
   role_id_seq -> Roles_id_seq
   user_id_seq -> Users_id_seq
   AccessMatix_id_seq -> AccessMatrices_id_seq
   Index_id_seq -> Indexes_id_seq
   role_id_seq -> Roles_id_seq
   Subindex_id_seq -> Subindexes_id_seq
6) Following Sequences are removed from public schema as they were not being used: Subindex_seq, UnitOfAnalysisClassType_id_seq,
   UnitOfAnalysisClassType_id_seq, UnitOfAnalysisTagLink_id_seq, UnitOfAnalysisTagLink_id_seq, UnitOfAnalysisType_id_seq,
   UnitOfAnalysisType_id_seq, UnitOfAnalysis_id_seq, UnitOfAnalysis_id_seq, brand_id_seq, country_id_seq, order_id_seq,
   transport_id_seq, transportmodel_id_seq, Index_seq
7) Following Sequences are removed from sceleton and test schemas
   JSON_id_seq, brand_id_seq, country_id_seq,  OWNE, transport_id_seq, transportmodel_id__seq, transport_id_seq,
   brand_id_seq, country_id_deq, order_id_seq, transportmodel_id_seq,
8) Data types for UnitOfAnalysisClassType , UnitOfAnalysisTag, UnitOfAnalysis, 'id' column changed from SMALLINT to INTEGER.
9) Unnecessary constraints UnitOfAnalysis_name_key1 and UnitOfAnalysis_name_key2 on UnitOfAnalysis.name is deleted.
10) Ids are converted to integer from smallint.
